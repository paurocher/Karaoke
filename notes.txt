Markers bar
 On this bar markers can be click-and-dragged and selected to see their properties
 on the Marker info bar.
 There is one for the sound and 1 or 2 for the text (depending on the text
 length, size, ...).
 THe sound one will have a fixed position under the sound. The text ones will
 get their position depending on the number of lines: always under the line of
 text.
 If a marker is dragged before or after another marker, together with its twin
 they are surrounded by a red square to indicate that both must be between the
 same markers. This will block the playing of sound as well ...

Menu bar containing the root menus.
These root menus are 1 object each.
On click on a root menu it draws its contents. This happens in the menu bar
object which grows its surface to accommodate the new coming sub items. Same
applies for sub and sub and sub menu items: everything is drawn on the menu bar object.
So the menuBar object needs the whole folder structure to draw children, place their
rect and pass the events to every child menu object.
